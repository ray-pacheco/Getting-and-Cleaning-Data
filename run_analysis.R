## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
## Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
